# Efficient NLP Pipeline for Bloom's Taxonomy
This repository offers all the needed source code for the project 'An Effective Pipeline For Bloom’s Taxonomy Using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning'.

## Project Summary: 
A significant aspect of evaluating students' progress and achievements is the question-creation process for examinations. With the piling abundance of textbooks, the manual annotation of good quality examination questions becomes a slow and time-consuming task for the faculty. This project presents a solution to these complications by demonstrating an effective pipeline for question generation using deep learning from a given text corpus. The generated questions are then classified into the cognitive domain of different Bloom’s taxonomy levels to gauge the complexity and specificity of the set questions.

The results of this research demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline in generating high-quality questions similar to manually annotated ones while saving time and effort.

This project comprises of three main aspects:
1. **Question Generation Module** - which uses the Squad 2.0 Dataset to generate questions based on given contexts.
2. **Question Classification Module** - a deep learning-based model for question classification under multiple categories of cognitive domain in Bloom's taxonomy.
3. **Semantic Similarity Assessment** - a case study done to evaluate how much the pipelined-generated questions maintain semantic similarity to manually annotated questions using Siamese neural networks.

Each module is well documented and organized separately in the repository with detailed explanation and relevant diagrams.
